        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A friend of mine got this recipe while traveling in Italy. Chicken, mushrooms, and tortellini in rich cream sauce. Delicious! Serve sprinkled with parsley and cheese.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cheese Tortellini:</strong> 1 (16 ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini</li>
          <li><strong>Vegetable Oil:</strong> 1 tablespoon of any vegetable oil</li>
          <li><strong>Chicken: </strong> 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed</li>
          <li><strong>Butter: </strong> about 3 tablespoons</li>
          <li><strong>Mushrooms:</strong> ½ pound sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
          <li><strong>Garlic powder:</strong> 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
          <li><strong>Whipping cream:</strong>  2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
          <li><strong>Parmesan:</strong> ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li><strong>Parsley:</strong> 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
          <li><strong>Salt:</strong> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add tortellini. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken breast in hot oil until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in another skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic powder until mushrooms begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir heavy cream into mushrooms and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese, parsley, and salt. Continue to cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir tortellini and chicken into mushroom-cream sauce. Simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
